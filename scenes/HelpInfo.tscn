This is the game where you, [b]yes you[/b], get to live out your long life dream of how life would have been digging dykes to stem the tide of the Atlantic. Your goal for the game is to reclaim land and make sure that your settlements grow. Think of it as a little bit of a gardening game.

Water will damage things you place down and settlements. However don't worry your proud dutch inhabitans will spur to action to repair any damage, as long as you have any available workers of course.

Workers are only generated by settlements, so I advice you to try and improve their growth whenever you can. However you can also get additional income from Tulip Fields.

If you feel you are getting a bit too much water over your ankles you can always pump it away. Keep in mind to build the pumps above water and then when they are finished to build pipes to any tiles with water on them. Pipes can also be built underground.

You control the camera by either using WASD or arrows, you can also drag the camera using the middle mouse button.


Hope you have fun!
